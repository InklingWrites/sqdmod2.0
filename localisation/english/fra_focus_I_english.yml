 FRA_devalue_the_franc_desc:1 "While other countries allowed their currencies to become less valuable to help their economies, we have steadfastly refused to do so. As a result, our economy is lagging behind others. If we want to become more competitive and weather the coming storm, we must not dismiss a devaluation of our currency out of hand, even if it would prove to be an unpopular measure."

 FRA_invest_in_syria:0 "Invest In Syria"
 FRA_invest_in_syria_desc:0 "Syria is perfectly positioned to supply us in case of a war in Europe or Africa. Enhancing its industrial potential will also support our position in the area."

 FRA_firepower_kills:0 "Firepower Kills"
 FRA_firepower_kills_desc:0 "The lessons of the Great War were as simple as they were cruel: the days of men fighting one another over open sights are over. Today, killing is done on a mass scale with the most modern weapons at a long range."
 FRA_methodical_battle:0 "Methodical Battle"
 FRA_methodical_battle_desc:0 "Some claim that battle is chaos, but they are fools. A battle is nothing but the methodical application of the right tools based on the overall plan. Plan well, and the enemy's intentions may as well be a historical footnote."

 FRA_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
 FRA_special_forces_desc:0 "In the future, the war will increasingly be fought in areas where the regular infantryman will meet his limit. We must create new and more capable formations that can perform in these conditions."

 FRA_battle_of_maneuver:0 "Battle of Maneuver"
 FRA_battle_of_maneuver_desc:0 "The old notion of a battlefield as a small area in which armies clash is dead. With mass-motorization, airplanes and fast radio communications, battles move fast over hundreds of kilometers. The sooner we prepare for this, the better."
 FRA_air_dominance_desc:0 "The development of the airplane has created a third flank for the army to worry about. We must secure this flank or face catastrophe."
 FRA_air_ground_cooperation:0 "Air-Ground Cooperation"
 FRA_air_ground_cooperation_desc:0 "Fighting in the air only ever creates actual military results if it is in pursuit of an objective on the ground. The better we integrate the battle in the air and the battle on the ground, the more effective we become."
 FRA_flying_artillery_desc:0 "In the fast-moving battles of today, the slow artillery pieces on the ground might not be able to keep up. Airplanes carrying bombs can take over their role."
 FRA_form_the_popular_front:0 "Form the Popular Front"
 FRA_form_the_popular_front_desc:1 "With the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy, it has become clear that the infighting on the left has to stop if our cause is to survive. A broad, popular front made up of all the parties on the left will have the popular mandate to finally address the economic conditions that create fascism."
 FRA_ban_communism_desc:0 "While it is inconceivable that anyone could seriously want to visit the chaos and bloodshed of a communist revolution upon their own fatherland, it appears that there are some amongst us who would do just that. We can not allow them to conspire against the state any longer. The harshest measures must be taken."
 FRA_invite_communist_ministers:0 "Invite Communist Ministers"
 FRA_invite_communist_ministers_desc:0 "Fear of backlash from the radical right prevented the inclusion of the communists in the actual government. But fear is a poor adviser. If we must have this clash, let them come."

 FRA_industrial_collectivization:0 "Industrial Collectivization"
 FRA_industrial_collectivization_desc:1 "The French economy today consists of tiny companies with few employees, forever competing against each other and sucking up resources in inefficient small-scale production. We will combine these small companies to finally create companies that can compete on the world stage."
 FRA_agricultural_collectivization_desc:0 "What applies to industry applies just as much to the farmers all across France. Tiny farms can't afford modern equipment, largely working as their great-grandfathers had. By combining them into agricultural production units, we will increase efficiency and output."
 FRA_force_the_issue:0 "Force the Issue"
 FRA_force_the_issue_desc:1 "We have come far since we formed the Popular Front. But we can not leave our work half-done. It is time for everyone on the left to make a choice and take a stand - either with the revolution or against it."

 FRA_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation"
 FRA_reconciliation_desc:0 "In the past, the French revolutions all too often hurled the country into endless spasms of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary terror. Perhaps it is time to build a republic in which everyone has their place, whether they supported the revolution or not."

 FRA_anti_fascist_coalition_desc:0 "The biggest threat to the march of progress is the spread of reactionary fascism. We must stand with every country that is willing to combat this threat, or there will not be a tomorrow for any of us."
 FRA_invite_anti_fascist_emigrants:0 "Invite Anti-Fascist Immigrants"
 FRA_invite_anti_fascist_emigrants_desc:1 "The first step every fascist regime takes is to exile its critics and the people who could present an alternative vision of how the country could be organized. However, these people are also perfectly suited to form a government-in-exile to prepare for the day their country is liberated."
 FRA_reconnect_to_the_balkans:0 "Reconnect To the Balkans"
 FRA_reconnect_to_the_balkans_desc:0 "France has long sought to counter-balance the powers of central Europe by reaching out to the countries of the Balkans. This connection is still there, even if it has been allowed to lapse more recently."

 FRA_pre_empt_the_fascist_attack_desc:0 "Why should we allow the enemy to prepare in peace and pick the moment that the inevitable attack happens when it best suits them? We will strike first, and crush this threat before it has time to get ready."
 FRA_loyalty_to_moscow:0 "Loyalty To Moscow"
 FRA_loyalty_to_moscow_desc:0 "The model of Socialism practiced in the Soviet Union might not be perfect, but it is beyond any reasonable doubt that the Soviet Union has achieved the highest degree of implementation of socialist ideas. We would be fools to try and find our own way."
 FRA_league_of_french_bolshevist_volunteers_desc:1 "When one socialist country is under threat by a foreign invader, all socialist countries are under threat. We must not sit idly by while our comrades fight for their lives."
 FRA_host_the_german_exiles:0 "Host the German Exiles"
 FRA_host_the_german_exiles_desc:0 "Germany, the home of Marx and Engels, was once at the forefront of communist thought and practice. Many German communists fled when the Nazis took power. If we give them a home, they can help us organize a more effective government of liberated territories."
 FRA_revolution_to_the_utmost:0 "Revolution To the Utmost"
 FRA_revolution_to_the_utmost_desc:0 "A revolution left half-finished is not a revolution at all. We must not stop until the deed is done and the new political system is safe. Whatever the cost."
 FRA_destroy_the_counter_revolution:0 "Destroy the Counter-Revolution"
 FRA_destroy_the_counter_revolution_desc:0 "Even now, some people in France prepare to stab the dagger into the back of their own people when they show even a second of weakness. We will not let them, and will strike first."

 FRA_loyalty_to_the_cause:0 "Loyalty To the Cause"
 FRA_loyalty_to_the_cause_desc:1 "Other countries may formulate their own visions of Communism, but there is no reason why we should compromise on ours. They may have stopped half-way, beset by doubt over whether the end justified the means. We won't."
 FRA_carry_the_revolution_north:0 "Carry the Revolution North"
 FRA_carry_the_revolution_north_desc:0 "Across the Channel lies the birthplace of the industrial revolution, and with it, the home of modern capitalism. We can not allow this place to become the springboard for a counter-revolutionary enemy."

 FRA_carry_the_revolution_south:0 "Carry the Revolution South"
 FRA_carry_the_revolution_south_desc:0 "The first country to fall to fascism was Italy. As a result, the ideology is firmly entrenched in Italy. Our world-views can not peacefully coexist. They know this as well as we do, and will no doubt prepare to act. So must we."
 FRA_egalite_liberte_solidarite_desc:1 "The first French Revolution swept away regimes that had lasted for a millennia, and changed the landscape of Europe forever. We will finish what they started."

 FRA_ban_the_leagues:0 "Ban the Leagues"
 FRA_ban_the_leagues_desc:0 "The far-right leagues have been allowed to organize unchecked. While they are currently too weak to try a coup, there is no telling of what they might be able to do in the future. Best to dissolve them now."
 FRA_the_blum_viollette_proposal:0 "The Blum-Viollette Proposal"
 FRA_the_blum_viollette_proposal_desc:1 "The citizenship of the French Republic should be open to anyone who qualifies. Many of our loyal subjects in Algeria would like to become full citizens, but are not yet allowed to do so. By making them full citizens, we would bind Algeria much closer to France."
 FRA_expand_the_citizenship:0 "Expand the Citizenship"
 FRA_expand_the_citizenship_desc:0 "It is intolerable for a republic that some of the people living on her territory would not be allowed to become her citizens, yet this state of affairs has been allowed to persist in our own. We must rectify this at once."

 FRA_encourage_immigration:0 "Encourage Immigration"

 FRA_confirm_eastern_commitments:0 "Confirm Eastern Commitments"
 FRA_confirm_eastern_commitments_desc:0 "After the Great War, we set up a network of alliances in Eastern Europe, as a counter-weight to a resurgent Germany and an expansionist Soviet Union. Our allies in the region are now wondering if we would actually come to their aid if we were called. We should reassure them before they decide to seek help elsewhere."
 FRA_strengthen_the_little_entente:0 "Strengthen the Little Entente"

 FRA_invest_in_our_weaker_allies_desc:0 "If we are to have capable allies in case of war, we must enable them to meet their own military needs. A program of moderate investments into their industry will allow them to produce the munitions they need locally."

 FRA_foreign_guest_workers:0 "Foreign Guest-Workers"
 FRA_foreign_guest_workers_desc:0 "Our lack of workers is a major bottleneck in expanding our industry and growing the size of our armed forces. Inviting skilled workers from our allies to work in our factories frees up manpower to send into the army."
 FRA_join_the_ententes:0 "Join the Ententes"
 FRA_join_the_ententes_desc:1 "France can not sustain two commitments of mutual defense at the same time. Unless we can get the British to agree to honor our commitments as well, we would have to choose.

 FRA_arms_purchases_in_the_us_desc:0 "Our military industry is simply not up to the task of supplying our forces with the necessary modern weapons. The US, however, has production capacity to spare.

 FRA_laissez_faire:0 "Laissez-Faire"
 FRA_laissez_faire_desc:0 "The Communists openly talk about remodelling the economic structure of our country in some radical way, of depriving the hard-working man of his rightful property.

 FRA_protect_the_rights_of_man:0 "Protect the Rights of Man"
 FRA_protect_the_rights_of_man_desc:0 "They may never say it openly, but it is obvious to anyone with eyes to see: curtailing the right to property is just the first step to eliminating all the rights our proud ancestors fought so hard for. We will not have it!"
 FRA_freedom_front:0 "Freedom Front"

 FRA_stimulate_the_dynamic_market:0 "Stimulate the Dynamic Market"
 FRA_stimulate_the_dynamic_market_desc:0 "The dynamic market has been proven to be the most efficient form of economic organization. But it is still run by humans, and human beings sometimes need some reassurances that their hard work will not be in vain. By legislating away some restrictions and giving guarantees, we can help investors overcome their fears and help stimulate our economy."
 FRA_agricultural_protectionism_desc:0 "The world economy has grown more and more hostile to our traditional ways of production. If we do not take measures to protect our farmers, we will soon face a crisis of untold proportions as our farmers are unable to remain competitive in the face of mass-produced foodstuffs coming in from overseas."

 FRA_economic_devolution_desc:0 "It is absurd to think that some bureaucrat in Paris knows what is best for a company in Bordeaux. We must trust our entrepeneurs and empower them to create their own solutions."
 FRA_promote_entrepeneurship:0 "Promote Entrepeneurship"
 FRA_promote_entrepeneurship_desc:0 "The beating heart of a dynamic market has always been the individual who, upon seeing an opportunity, moves quickly to exploit it. In recent years, this spirit has been smothered with unnecessary regulations. We should roll them back."
 FRA_utilize_the_leagues:0 "Utilize the Leagues"
 FRA_utilize_the_leagues_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that political violence has become commonplace in France. If the country is to survive the threat of communist revolution, we must not shy away from the help of people who can and will meet the communist thugs in the street if it comes to that."

 FRA_political_unity:0 "Political Unity"
 FRA_political_unity_desc:1 "The history of France since the fall of absolutism has been a story of political infighting. When there was unity - France was victorious.

 FRA_diplomatic_freedom:0 "Diplomatic Freedom"
 FRA_diplomatic_freedom_desc:1 "The republican governments have shackled themselves to artificial constructs in Eastern Europe who will fall the moment we withdraw our aid. They are liabilities, not assets, and as such we will divest ourselves of them."

 FRA_establish_spheres_of_influence_desc:1 "For centuries, our people have lived in the belief that we were mortal, hereditary enemies.

 FRA_the_council_of_rambouillet_desc:0 "With the country in turmoil, the people look for a strong leader.

While some detractors would prefer a different candidate for the throne, there can be little doubt that the Orleanist heir has the best chances to peacefully unite the country behind him."
 FRA_guarantee_the_constitution:0 "Guarantee the Constitution"
 FRA_guarantee_the_constitution_desc:0 "Before the republican press can even launch its unfounded campaigns against the legitimacy of royal rule, we must erode their standing by giving iron-clad guarantees to respect the individual rights of the people."

 FRA_the_first_citizen_of_the_state_desc:0 "The king, while imbued with considerable power, must never be seen as a tyrant or absolutist ruler of the old kind. Instead, a modern monarch must respect the law and be the first line of defense against those that would usurp power illegally."
 FRA_counter_action_desc:0 "The Action Francaise has long been the strongest advocate for a return to the monarchy. Unfortunately, their views on other subjects are less palatable. It is time to inform them that they have served their purpose and dispose of them."

 FRA_no_further_humiliations_desc:0 "For years, successive republican governments have allowed the Germans to run roughshod over international treaties, some of which were brazenly broken before the ink was even dry. This ends now."

 FRA_the_legitimate_heir:0 "The Legitimate Heir"
 FRA_the_legitimate_heir_desc:1 "The Legitimists consider the Carlist branch to be the legitimate heir to the throne of France. Appointing their candidate to the throne opens up the tantalizing possibility of ruling Spain and France in a double-monarchy."
 FRA_secure_the_crown_of_spain:0 "Secure the Crown of Spain"
 FRA_secure_the_crown_of_spain_desc:0 "The first step towards claiming the king's birthrights is to secure Spain from the various pretender governments that have sprung up. Their petty squabbles have thrown the country into a bloody civil war once already - we must not let them do so again."

 FRA_two_countries_two_crowns:0 "Two Countries, Two Crowns"
 FRA_two_countries_two_crowns_desc:0 "There is no feasible way in which we could unite the countries where one would not consider itself a subject of the other. We will instead advise the king to rule both in a personal, but not a legal, union."
 FRA_proclaim_the_third_empire:0 "Proclaim the Third Empire"

 FRA_retribution_for_sedan_desc:0 "For more than half a century, the Germans have celebrated the Battle of Sedan, and their triumph over Napoleon the Third there. In the future, every German will learn to curse the name of that place."
 FRA_disunite_germany:0 "Disunite Germany"
 FRA_disunite_germany_desc:0 "The triumph over France allowed Prussia to unite the smaller German states under her banner. It is only right that this process is reversed, now that the Germans have been defeated."
 FRA_return_to_borodino:0 "Return To Borodino"
 FRA_return_to_borodino_desc:0 "At Borodino, Napoleon came closest to achieving his victory in Europe. The Russian Army was all but destroyed, and had he been just a little faster, he could have brought the Russians to terms. We will show the world that it can be done."
 FRA_je_suis_la_deluge:1 "Je Suis Le Déluge"

 VIC_the_national_revolution_desc:1 "Our defeat was without a doubt caused by a fundamental flaw in our nation. It will take a long time to remedy this flaw, but perhaps the shock of our defeat will allow us to return stronger."
 VIC_long_term_economic_planning:0 "Long-Term Economic Planning"
 VIC_long_term_economic_planning_desc:1 "While it is tempting to see the current situation as so important that it supersedes all other concerns, we must not forget that there are things that take a long time to implement. By creating a series of economic plans, we can grow our economy in an efficient manner."
 VIC_aid_small_businesses:0 "Aid Small Businesses"

 VIC_venerate_the_craftsman_desc:0 "For too long has the discussion of labour focused on the industrial worker, who works in a large factory for a big company. It is time to show the accomplishments of the skilled craftsman, working in his own workshop, providing for his family."
 VIC_down_with_marianne:0 "Down With Marianne"
 VIC_down_with_marianne_desc:1 "The pseudo-religious worship of Marianne, the symbol of French republicanism, has twisted the minds of our people. Much like the worthless Republic she represents, all traces of her must be eradicated."

 VIC_up_with_jean_darc_desc:1 "Jeanne d'Arc fought bravely against a seemingly overwhelming enemy, sacrificed all she had for the good of the fatherland, and rallied the nation under her banner to throw out the invaders. Surely she is a much better symbol for our youth to aspire to than Marianne?"
 VIC_celebrate_motherhood:0 "Celebrate Motherhood"
 VIC_celebrate_motherhood_desc:0 "It is inherently obvious that a woman's place is in the household, just as it is the man's place to be at the workbench or in the field. Our people must be reminded that a woman's work is every bit as vital for the survival of the nation as the man's."
 VIC_prosecute_the_losers:0 "Prosecute the Losers"
 VIC_prosecute_the_losers_desc:0 "France held out for years against the Kaiser's armies, yet folded in the present war. There must be a reason for this, and we must not stop until it is brought to light and the people responsible are brought to justice."

 VIC_mandatory_work_service:0 "Mandatory Work Service"
 VIC_mandatory_work_service_desc:1 "We have managed to secure a promise from the Germans that we will have our occupation costs reduced if we supply them with labourers. However, it appears few amongst the people are willing to do the necessary work to help their fatherland in its hour of need. Where incentives have failed, we must now regretfully use compulsion."
 VIC_a_nation_reborn:0 "A Nation Reborn"

 VIC_finish_the_naval_buildup_desc:0 "The late republic laid down a number of ships to modernize the fleet. Begun too late and pursued too slowly, it could not be finished in time. But it may yet serve as the nucleus of a new French Navy."
 VIC_hidden_materials:0 "Hidden Materials"

 VIC_modernize_the_airforce:0 "Modernize the Airforce"
 VIC_modernize_the_airforce_desc:0 "Perhaps the most humiliating part of our defeat was our inability to compete in the air. We had too few modern planes. As the war continues around us, new planes are rapidly put into production. We must not let a similar thing happen again."

 FRA_reach_out_to_trade_unions_desc:0 "If we are to strike against the industries that have now been pressed into service by the enemy, having good communications with the workers there seems like the best way.

 FRA_the_old_school_desc:0 "Despite all advances in naval technology, the key element of sea power is still the capital ship acting with the support of other fleet units. Whether this capital ship is still the battleship or is the new aircraft carrier, we must further increase the size of our shipbuilding industry to ensure we can keep pace with other naval powers."
